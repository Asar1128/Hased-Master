                    Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. was a founded January 5, 1911, on the campus of Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana.  The percentage of Blacks on campus was less than one percent.  Blacks could go weeks without seeing one another on campus.  Blacks were not allowed to reside in on-campus dormitories, were not afforded off-campus accommodations, and they were also denied the use of all other university facilities and were barred from participating in contact sports.  Two young black men, Elder Watson Diggs, and Byron Kenneth Armstrong had previously attended Howard University. Their experiences at Howard gave rise to the chief motivating spirits which sowed of the seed for a fraternity at Indiana University and crystallized the idea of establishing an independent Greek-letter organization.</br>

Consequently, eight other men met with Diggs and Armstrong for the purpose of organizing such a fraternity.  The charter members were Elder Watson Diggs, Byron K. Armstrong, John M. Lee, Henry T. Asher, Marcus P. Blakemore, Guy L. Grant, Paul W. Caine, George W. Edmonds, Ezra D. Alexander, and Edward G. Irvin.</br></br>

The Founders were serious-minded young men who possessed the imagination, ambition, courage, and determination to defy customary entrance into a career for the pursuit of a college education.

These men of vision decided the Fraternity would be more than another social organization. Reliance would be placed upon high ideals and the purpose of ACHIEVEMENT.

The Fraternity would seek to raise the sights of black youths and stimulate them to accomplish higher than might otherwise be realized or even imagined. </br></br>

On January 5, 1911, the Fraternity became known as Kappa Alpha Nu, possibly as a tribute to the Black students of the Alpha Kappa Nu Greek Society who preceded them at Indiana University in 1903. </br></br>

Kappa Alpha Nu would be the only Greek-letter organization founded with the concept of ACHIEVEMENT. They began uniting college men of culture, patriotism, and honor in a bond of fraternity. Primarily, under the efforts and leadership of the calm, methodical, and philosophical Elder W. Diggs and the critical, and scholarly Byron K. Armstrong, the Kappa Alpha Nu Fraternity was founded.

Since the beginning, every endeavor was directed toward establishing the Fraternity upon a strong foundation before embarking on plans of expansion. Careful consideration was given to ensure the organization established a firm foundation the first year before efforts to expand were attempted. </br></br> 

​Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc., is comprised of functioning Undergraduate and Alumni Chapters on major campuses and in cities throughout the country as well as other continents, is the crystallization of a dream. It is the beautiful realization of a vision shared commonly by the late revered founders that enabled them to sow the seed of a fraternal tree whose fruit is available to, and now enjoyed by college men everywhere, regardless of their color, religion, or national origin.

                            Founder George Wesley Edmonds was witty and an enigma to most in the fraternity. He was born in Knight Township, Vanderburgh County, Indiana, on August 13, 1890, and was the eldest of two sons.</br>

                            He attended Clark High School in nearby Evansville, Indiana, and enrolled at Indiana University in the fall of 1910. He joined nine other students in founding Kappa Alpha Nu Fraternity. </br>
                            Edmonds was listed as the Corresponding Secretary in the articles of incorporation of the Grand Chapter of Kappa Alpha Nu. </br>
                            He was one of the three freshmen, along with Asher and Blakemore, who were the first initiates of the Alpha of Kappa Alpha Nu.

                            Founder Guy Levis Grant was small in stature but was a giant in charitable endeavors and a preserver of history.  He was born in New Albany, Indiana, on April 9, 1891, and was the third of thirteen children, five of whom became members of the fraternity. </br>W
                            hen his father died, he became head of the household and assumed responsibility for educating himself and his siblings.

                            Grant attended public schools in his hometown, graduated from Scribner High School in 1909, and entered Indiana University. </br>
                            While there, he majored in chemistry, graduating with an A.B. degree in 1915. In 1920, he received a D.D.S. degree from Indiana Dental School, then a part of Indiana University.  He practiced dentistry in Indianapolis for over 50 years.

                            Founder John Milton Lee was a scholar, loyal, and tireless worker for the growth of the fraternity. Due to his idealist character was commonly referred to as ‘a dreamer’ during the fraternity’s early years. He was born in Danville, Indiana, on September 7, 1890, and was the third of four children.</br>

                            He attended Danville public schools and enrolled at Indiana University in 1910. He completed three years of pre-medical work before leaving the university. In 1914, he enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania but withdrew for health reasons. In 1915, he became a student at Temple University but was compelled to leave due to a death in the family.
